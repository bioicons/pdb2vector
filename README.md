# pdb2vector

This [web-application](http://bioicons.github.io/pdb2vector) gives a convenient way to interact with a wide variety of proteins from the RCSB protein databank. It was designed to simplify the workflow of preparing 2D vector graphic illustrations used e.g. in scientific publications by integrating all relevant components into one application. The application can be intuitively controlled by LoupeDeck using provided configurations.
